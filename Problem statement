The HotelApp needs to manage various hotel services for guest check-in and check-out. 
These services include valet parking for vehicles, room cleaning, and handling luggage carts.
However, the HotelApp aims to interact with these services through a simplified, single interface provided by the FrontDesk. 
The FrontDesk class should delegate the client's requests to the appropriate service classes (Valet, HouseKeeping, Cart) while abstracting the service details from the client.
